## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - We are trying to copy every Hypixel gamemode/minigame!*

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)


*We are doing this to challenge our coding skills. Hypixel is a great server and you should definitely play on it!
